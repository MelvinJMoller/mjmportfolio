                It follows the same <br>
                "philosophy" as the JavaScript one,<br>
                 a "free" BlackJack game.<br>

                <p>This is from a school project written in react native.<br>
                At the time of writing this program, I was a little<br>
                rusty. This resulted in me not being very proud <br>
                of this program but it is the only one I wrote in react native,<br>
                so I think it still deserves a spot here.<br>
                It is very simple app where you write stuff to do.</p>
