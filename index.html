                <p>This is my android project, written in kotlin.<br>
                The goal in the game is to find the cats <br>
                in each picture and tap on them.
                The graphics are <br>
                created in 'Whitelines' and is supposed <br>
                to look a bit rough, however it did not look<br>
                so good in the end.</p>

                It is a website for my friend, who<br>
                is an artist.<br>
                This website contains some PHP, which might<br>
                not run properly were you to try and run<br>
                this code.</p>

                <p>Here is another blackjack project, <br>
                this time written in python.
                It follows the same <br>
                "philosophy" as the JavaScript one,<br>
                 a "free" BlackJack game.<br>
                It is a bit different since it is not written<br>

                <p>This is from a school project written in react native.<br>
                At the time of writing this program, I was a little<br>
                rusty. This resulted in me not being very proud <br>
                of this program but it is the only one I wrote in react native,<br>
                so I think it still deserves a spot here.<br>
                It is very simple app where you write and remove<br>
                stuff to do.</p>
