                    <h3>FindGas</h3>
                    <p>Findgas is an android app with a gps that finds the nearest gas stations. The plan with this app was to help you find the nearest
                        gas station with as little time as possible. It has problably happened that you have drove through an area you don't know and
                        you are running a bit low on gas, thats when you can open up this app and quickly find your way to the nearest gas station. <br>
                        This is definately one of my bigger projects.

                    <h3>Cat Tapper</h3>
                    <p>This is an android app, written in kotlin. It is a game about finding the hidden cat on the different levels. The stage order
                        is randomised to avoid memorisation. Try to get the best time possible!<br>
                        For this game I had an idéa to make the graphics look sort of rough. I wanted it to look like scribbles on a paper, so I used 
                        'Whitelines'. That is a software That can scan pages in a "special" notebook created by the same company. You can then 
                        use these pages digitally. In the end I think it sort of gave mixed results, while I think it did achieve the rough, it just
                        does not look so good.

                    <h3>Simple Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
                    <p>This is an iOS app, written in swift of course. It is just a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe, hence the name "Simple Tic-Tac-Toe".
                        Try to get three O's and X's in a row and you win. The game can also end in a stalemate. One thing I regret with this app is
                        that you can put down more than 3 O's and X's. If I were to limit it to only 3 at a time and you had to move them once it was
                        your turn, I think it would made for a more interesting game. <br>
                        This app was also published for a while on the Appstore, but has since been taken down due to me not paying for developer anymore.

                    <h3>DailyGoals</h3>
                    <p>A very simple to do app written in react native. You can add and remove tasks. This was an app written for a school project,
                        my first project in a while so I was a little rusty. I don't really like this app. I think it is too basic and ugly but it
                        is the only app here written in react native, so I still want to show it of here.
